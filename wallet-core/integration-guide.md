# Wallet Core Integration Guide

This Integration Guide is intended for developers building on top of Wallet Core.  Typical projects using Wallet Core are *mobile wallets* -- iOS and/or Android apps, and potentially desktop wallets.
Wallet Core functionality can prove to be helpful in some backend-side projects as well.
  
The guide has the following outline:

* [Wallet Core Usage Guide](wallet-core-usage.md).
In this general guide we describe the basic wallet operations (*wallet creation*, *address derivation*, *transaction signing*) in detail, with some code examples.  This is recommended first.

* [iOS Integration Guide](ios-guide.md).
This is a walkthrough of a sample iOS wallet application.

* [Android Integration Guide](android-guide.md).
This is a walkthrough of a sample Android wallet application.

* [Server-Side GoLang Guide](server-side.md).
Here we provide instructions on how to integrate Wallet Core into a *Go* language backend-side project.
